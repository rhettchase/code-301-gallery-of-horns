## Gallery of Horns

I built an app that displays images and information of horned animals. The app takes information on each animal and displays it in a Gallery of Horns.

### Reflections and Comments

- I learned that workflow when working with React will need to be different to not throw errors
- I learned how to import and export different components to be used throughout the app using `import` and `export`
- I used the provided `.json` data and iterated over the array of objects by using the `.map()` method
- I used `props` to dynamically render content on the page
